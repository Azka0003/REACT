# Static Component Reuse (Props)

This folder demonstrates **reusing the same React component multiple times**
by passing **hard-coded props**.

## Concepts Covered
- Reusable React components
- Passing data using props
- Conditional rendering using props
- Rendering multiple component instances

## What is Happening Here
- The `Joke` component is reused several times
- Data is passed manually through props
- Structure is reusable, but data is still hard-coded

## Limitation
- Adding new data requires manually writing another component instance
- Not scalable for large or dynamic data

## Purpose
This example helps understand the need for **data-driven rendering**
before moving to arrays and `.map()`.
