# Hard-Coded React Component 🧱

This folder demonstrates a **hard-coded React component** where both the
structure and the data are written directly inside the component.

## What is Hard Coding in React?

Hard coding means:
- UI structure and content are fixed inside the component
- The same data is rendered every time
- No props or external data are used

## What is Done Here

- React component is created using a function
- JSX is written directly inside the component
- Content is repeated manually
- No reusability for different data

## Limitation of This Approach

- Code repetition increases
- Component is not reusable
- Any data change requires modifying the component itself

## Purpose

This example is used to **understand the problem** that React solves later
using **props and data-driven rendering**.

This is a starting point before moving to reusable components.
