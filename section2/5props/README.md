# Reusable Components with Props (Level 2)

This folder demonstrates **Level-2 React concepts** where components are reusable
but data is still passed **manually using props**.

## Concepts Covered

- Reusable React components
- Passing data using props
- Props destructuring in function parameters
- Rendering the same component multiple times
- Importing images in React and passing them as props
- Using relative paths for static assets

## What is Happening Here

- `Contact` is a reusable component
- Each `<Contact />` call receives different props
- Images are imported and passed as props instead of hard-coding paths
- The UI structure remains the same while content changes

## Level Classification

- **Level 2**: Reusable components with hard-coded props  
- Data is not yet driven by arrays or `.map()`

## Key Takeaway

React components define the structure, props supply the data,
and importing assets like images is the recommended way in React projects.
