# React Challenge 2 🧱

This folder focuses on **React composability** and
**parent-child component relationships**.

## Concepts Covered

- Component-based folder structure
- Parent and child components
- Reusable UI components
- Importing components inside other components

## Folder Structure

- `Components/` → child components
- `App.jsx` → parent component
- `index.jsx` → entry point

## What I Practiced

- Breaking UI into smaller components
- Organizing components properly
- Building UI by composing multiple components together

## Key Takeaway

React follows a **component-based architecture**
where complex UI is built by combining smaller, reusable components.
