# React Basics 📘

This folder contains my React **basics practice**.

## Concepts Covered

- `React.createElement()`
- Functional Components
- Rendering elements using `createRoot`
- Components returning **a single root element**
- Imperative vs Declarative approach
- Using placeholder/root element from HTML (`<div id="root">`)

## What I Practiced Here

- Creating elements without JSX
- Writing simple functional components
- Understanding how React renders UI
- How React controls the DOM using a single root
- Difference between imperative DOM manipulation and declarative React code

## Key Understanding

- React renders everything inside **one root element**
- Components must return **one parent element**
- React uses a **declarative approach**, not imperative DOM updates
- HTML provides the root container, React controls everything inside it

## Purpose

This folder is only for understanding **core React fundamentals** before moving to:
- JSX
- Props
- State
- Advanced components
