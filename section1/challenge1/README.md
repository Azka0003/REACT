# React Challenge 1 🔹

This folder contains my first React challenge focused on
**importing functions and using them as components**.

## Concepts Covered

- Creating React components using functions
- Importing components into the main file
- Rendering components inside a single root
- Understanding basic composability

## What I Practiced

- Writing logic inside separate files
- Importing components instead of writing everything in one file
- Understanding how React builds UI using functions

## Key Takeaway

React applications are built by **splitting UI into functions**
and importing them where needed, instead of writing all code in one file.
