# ⚛️ React Learning Journey

This repository documents my **React.js learning journey**, covering core concepts, hooks, routing, state management, and hands-on mini projects built using **Vite**.

I initially started learning React from **freeCodeCamp**, which provides strong and practical examples. I completed the first three sections (around 7–8 hours). Later, I switched to **Sangam Mukherjee’s React JS course**, as his teaching style suited me better and helped me understand concepts more clearly.
